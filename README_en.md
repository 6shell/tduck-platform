## I. About TDuck

TDuck Fill-in-the-Blank Form is one of the first open-source questionnaire/form collection tools in China based on Vue.

The system adopts the concept of no-code design. Users can create questionnaire forms by dragging and dropping, with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get experience. At the same time, it also supports professional technicians to develop custom components on their own to meet the personalized needs of different enterprises and organizations. The system uses the SpringBoot+Vue+ElementUI technology stack, which can be quickly mastered without complex learning. It is powerful, has a fresh UI interface, and can quickly empower business for enterprises and organizations through brief deployment.
